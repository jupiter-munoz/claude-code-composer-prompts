# ============================================================================
# STAKEHOLDER VALIDATION QUESTIONS
# ============================================================================

stakeholder_questions:
  approvers:
    - "When application is 'Returned for Information', do you expect to see exactly what changed when applicant resubmits?"
    - "How do you currently handle watch list checks? Check both lists for every applicant, or only when suspicious?"
    - "For non-USF prerequisite certificates, how often do you contact other OTI centers? All certificates or only suspicious ones?"
    - "For courses with alternative prerequisites (like #5600 requiring #500 OR #501 OR #5400), how do you document which path applicant satisfied?"
    - "When degree or certification substitutes for 2 years of experience, can full 5 years be 3 years work + 2 years substitution?"

  applicants:
    - "If applying for multiple courses at once, would you prefer one combined form or separate forms per course?"
    - "When uploading supporting documents, would you find it helpful if system told you exactly which documents still needed?"
    - "If application returned for more information, how would you prefer to communicate with reviewer - structured form, email, or both?"

  administrators:
    - "Is monthly watch list upload acceptable, or would you prefer automated integration if possible?"
    - "What happens if course needs to be added or changed between monthly imports? Who handles this?"
    - "Should system enforce 35% safety work threshold automatically, or should reviewers have discretion to override?"

# ============================================================================
# ENHANCEMENT VALIDATION QUESTIONS
# ============================================================================

enhancement_questions:
  application_communication:
    - "Should applicants be able to initiate communications through system, or only view system-generated messages and reviewer responses?"
    - "Should communication history be visible to all reviewers, or only assigned reviewer?"
    - "What types of communications should trigger email notifications vs just in-system notifications?"

  application_change_history:
    - "Should change history show all field changes, or only changes to specific critical fields?"
    - "Should applicants also see their own change history, or is this just for reviewers?"
    - "Would side-by-side comparison view be valuable, or is change log sufficient?"

# PROTOTYPE SCENARIOS

    validation: "Verify all entities capture necessary data without gaps"

  - scenario: "Complex Multi-Course with Substitutions"
    description: "Existing applicant applies for both #500 and #501, has OSH bachelor's degree (2 years credit), has CSP certification (2 years credit max), documents 3 years combined experience, provides #510 and #511 completions, approver validates and approves"
    validation: "Verify education, certification, and experience substitution logic; verify two APPLICATION_COURSE records with separate validation"

  - scenario: "Application Returned for Information"
    description: "Applicant submits #5400, provides #5410 certificate 8 years old (expired), reviewer returns requesting valid prerequisite, applicant takes new #5410 and updates, system tracks as version 2, reviewer sees changes and approves"
    validation: "Verify version tracking, change history, parent_application_id linkage"

  - scenario: "Watch List with Reinstatement"
    description: "Applicant submits #501, reviewer checks watch lists and finds on OTI internal list, system requires reinstatement letter, applicant uploads official OSHA reinstatement, reviewer validates letter and approves application"
    validation: "Verify WATCH_LIST_CHECK junction, WATCH_LIST_ENTRY lookup, REINSTATEMENT_LETTER sub-process"

final_notes:
  summary: "This data model supports all documented business processes from USF OSHA Prerequisites requirements while maintaining strict source traceability. YAML format enables both human readability and machine parsing for code generation."

  key_design_decisions:
    - "Separate APPLICATION_COURSE entity enables individual prerequisite validation per course within multi-course applications"
    - "PREREQUISITE_COURSE_COMPLETION with temporal validation supports 7-year validity windows"
    - "Watch list sub-process fully modeled with WATCH_LIST_CHECK junction and REINSTATEMENT_LETTER"
    - "Version tracking via parent_application_id and version_number supports resubmission workflow"
    - "DOCUMENT type used throughout for file uploads per Appian platform standards"
    - "USERNAME and GROUP types replace custom user/role tables per platform best practices"
    - "Enhanced attribute properties (validation, searchable, conditional_required, etc.) provide implementation guidance"
    - "allowed_values used for simple enumerations to reduce reference table proliferation"

  implementation_readiness: "Ready for stakeholder review, validation question resolution, and Appian Composer/development"
