## BUSINESS RULE IMPLICATIONS

### Validation Rules from Source

**1. Safety Experience Percentage Threshold (Line 87)**
- **Source Quote:** "35% cutoff for percentage of time spent on safety related tasks when listing prior employment (field 17); this cutoff is not transparent to the users"
- **Data Model Support:** `Employment_History.safety_percentage` field stores the percentage; validation logic in application layer checks against 35% threshold
- **Business Rule:** Jobs with <35% safety work may not count toward experience requirements

**2. Application Deadline (Line 88)**
- **Source Quote:** "2 week cutoff for applications prior to course start date"
- **Data Model Support:** `Course.start_date` compared with `Application.submission_date`
- **Business Rule:** Applications submitted less than 2 weeks before course start are invalid

**3. Prerequisite Course Validity Window (Line 92)**
- **Source Quote:** "Key prerequisite courses, such as the OSHA 510 and 511, are only valid for seven years"
- **Data Model Support:** `Prerequisite_Course_Completion.completion_date` and `expiration_date` (calculated as completion_date + 7 years); `Prerequisite_Course.validity_period_years`
- **Business Rule:** Prerequisite course completion must be within 7 years of selected course start date

**4. Credential Expiration Validation (Line 91)**
- **Source Quote:** "Credentials must not expire before course start date"
- **Data Model Support:** `Professional_Certification.expiration_date` compared with `Course.start_date`
- **Business Rule:** System validates certification expiration against course start date

**5. Experience Substitution with Education (Line 90)**
- **Source Quote:** "An approved degree (one of two specific majors) can substitute for 2 years of required experience"
- **Data Model Support:** `Education_Credential.years_experience_credit` and junction table `Course_Academic_Major_Requirement`
- **Business Rule:** OSH or IH bachelor's degree = 2 years experience credit; `Education_Credential.academic_major` must match approved majors

**6. Experience Substitution with Certification (Line 90)**
- **Source Quote:** Certifications can substitute for 2 years
- **Data Model Support:** `Professional_Certification.years_experience_credit` and junction table `Course_Certification_Requirement`
- **Business Rule:** Valid CSP, CIH, CMC certifications = 2 years experience credit each

**7. Maximum Experience Substitution (Line 67)**
- **Source Quote:** "A maximum of 2 years of experience can be substituted"
- **Data Model Support:** Application logic sums `years_experience_credit` from Education_Credential and Professional_Certification tables
- **Business Rule:** Total substitution cannot exceed 2 years regardless of multiple credentials

**8. Contract Course Registration Code (Line 70)**
- **Source Quote:** "Cannot process applications for contracted courses without the correct registration code"
- **Data Model Support:** `Course.is_contract_course` flag and `Course.registration_code`
- **Business Rule:** If course is contract course, applicant must provide matching registration code

**9. Watch List Reinstatement Requirement (Line 79)**
- **Source Quote:** "They can only be approved if they provide an official 'reinstatement letter' from OSHA"
- **Data Model Support:** `Watch_List_Check.found_on_list` triggers `Watch_List_Check.reinstatement_required`; `Reinstatement_Letter` table tracks letter and approval
- **Business Rule:** Applicant found on watch list cannot be approved without valid reinstatement letter

**10. Prior Employment Field Requirements (Line 65)**
- **Source Quote:** "For the prior employer section, all fields are required"
- **Data Model Support:** All fields in `Employment_History` (except end_date for current employment)
- **Business Rule:** System enforces completion of all employment history fields

**11. Course Date Mandatory (Line 89)**
- **Source Quote:** "Course start date is mandatory in all cases as part of the application"
- **Data Model Support:** `Course.start_date` is NOT NULL; `Application_Course` requires valid course_id with start_date
- **Business Rule:** Cannot create application without selecting course with start date

**12. Hours Per Week Calculation (Line 68)**
- **Source Quote:** "For field 17, provide a field for 'hours per week devoted to safety-related tasks' and a field for 'hours worked per week'"
- **Data Model Support:** `Employment_History.hours_per_week_safety` and `hours_per_week_total`
- **Business Rule:** System can calculate actual safety percentage from these two fields

### Business Process State Management

**Application Status Transitions:**
1. Draft → Submitted (applicant completes and signs)
2. Submitted → Under Review (reviewer begins evaluation)
3. Under Review → Approved/Denied/Returned (reviewer makes decision)
4. Returned → Submitted (applicant resubmits with changes)

**Data Model Support:** `Application.application_status_code` foreign key to `Application_Status` reference table; `Application.version_number` tracks resubmissions; `Application.parent_application_id` links versions

**Prerequisite Validation Status per Course:**
1. Not Started → In Progress (reviewer begins checking)
2. In Progress → Meets/Does Not Meet/Requires Additional Info
3. Requires Additional Info → In Progress (after applicant provides info)

**Data Model Support:** `Application_Course.validation_status_code` foreign key to `Validation_Status`; allows independent status per course in multi-course applications

### Workflow Enforcement

**Document Signature Workflow:**
1. System generates PDF from wizard data → `Application_Course.generated_pdf_document_id`
2. Applicant signs via DocuSign → `Application_Course.signed_pdf_document_id` and `applicant_signature_date`
3. Upon approval, reviewer signs → `Application_Course.reviewer_signature_date`
4. Re-sign required if applicant edits and resubmits

**Data Model Support:** Separate tracking of generated vs. signed PDFs; date fields track signature timeline

**Watch List Verification Workflow:**
1. Check OSHA public watch list → `Watch_List_Check` (OSHA_PUBLIC)
2. Check internal OTI watch list → `Watch_List_Check` (OTI_INTERNAL)
3. If found on either → `found_on_list` = TRUE, `reinstatement_required` = TRUE
4. Applicant uploads reinstatement letter → `Reinstatement_Letter` table
5. Reviewer reviews letter → `Reinstatement_Letter.is_approved`
6. Cannot approve application without approved reinstatement

**Data Model Support:** `Watch_List_Check` junction table links Application to Watch_List_Entry; `Reinstatement_Letter` table tracks sub-process completion

**Prerequisite Verification External Checks:**
- Certificate verification with external OTI centers → `Prerequisite_Course_Completion.verified_with_issuing_center`
- Professional certification verification via websites → `Professional_Certification.verified_by_reviewer` and `external_verification_url`
- Transcript verification (visual seal check) → `Education_Credential.verified_by_reviewer`

**Data Model Support:** Verification boolean fields and notes fields track manual verification steps; reference to Appendix A URLs

### Reporting and Analytics Requirements

**Task Report (Line 155):**
- **Source Quote:** "Task Report: Tracks in-progress applications"
- **Data Model Support:** Query `Application` where `application_status_code` IN ('Submitted', 'Under Review', 'Returned')

**Completed Report (Line 156):**
- **Source Quote:** "Completed Report: Search by applicant or date range"
- **Data Model Support:** Query `Application` JOIN `Applicant` where `application_status_code` IN ('Approved', 'Denied'); filter by `Applicant.legal_name` or `Application.decision_date`

**Facilitator Report (Line 157):**
- **Source Quote:** "Facilitators can access a list of approved applicants per class"
- **Data Model Support:** Query `Application_Course` JOIN `Application` JOIN `Applicant` JOIN `Course` where `Application.final_decision_code` = 'APPROVE' and `Application_Course.is_approved` = TRUE; filter by `Course.course_id`

**Dashboard Metrics (Line 154):**
- **Source Quote:** "dashboard showing application numbers, historical application and course enrollment data"
- **Data Model Support:**
  - Application counts: COUNT(*) from `Application` group by status/date
  - Approval rates: COUNT(*) where approved / total submitted
  - Popular courses: COUNT(*) from `Application_Course` group by `course_id`
  - Average review time: AVG(`review_completed_date` - `submission_date`)

### Temporal Constraints and Validation Windows

**Seven-Year Prerequisite Window:**
- **Data Model Support:** `Prerequisite_Course_Completion.completion_date` + `Prerequisite_Course.validity_period_years` must be >= `Course.start_date` selected in `Application_Course`
- **Validation Query:** Compare dates across prerequisite tracking and course selection

**Two-Week Application Cutoff:**
- **Data Model Support:** `Application.submission_date` must be >= (`Course.start_date` - 14 days)
- **Validation Query:** Block submission if within 2-week window

**Credential Validity:**
- **Data Model Support:** `Professional_Certification.expiration_date` must be >= `Course.start_date`
- **Validation Query:** Check expiration against course date

**Ten-Year Trainer Card Age:**
- **Source Quote:** "expiration date no more than ten (10) years old" (Line 221)
- **Data Model Support:** `Outreach_Trainer_Authorization.expiration_date` must be within 10 years
- **Validation Query:** Check trainer card age for previously authorized trainers

### Evidence Tracking and Verification Requirements

**Prerequisite Course Certificate Verification:**
- Non-USF certificates require manual verification (phone/email) → `Prerequisite_Course_Completion.is_from_usf`, `verified_with_issuing_center`, `verification_notes`
- Document attachment required → `Prerequisite_Course_Completion.certificate_document_id`

**Transcript Verification:**
- Visual verification for seal and signature → `Education_Credential.verified_by_reviewer`, `verification_notes`
- Official transcript required → `Education_Credential.transcript_document_id`

**Professional Certification Verification:**
- External website verification → `Professional_Certification.verified_by_reviewer`, `external_verification_url`, `verification_date`
- Certificate document required → `Professional_Certification.certification_document_id`

**Employment Verification:**
- Contact person verification → `Employment_History.employment_verified` and contact fields
- Calculated experience → `Employment_History.calculated_years_experience`

## ENHANCEMENT IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Table S1: Application_Communication - Impact Analysis

**Process Improvement:**
- **Current Pain Point:** "Applicants frequently email to check the status of their application because they don't receive an automatic confirmation and are unsure if their submission was successful"
- **Solution:** Structured communication log visible to applicants in self-service portal reduces anxiety and follow-up emails
- **Additional Benefit:** Creates audit trail of all communications; eliminates need to manually save email copies as supporting documents

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH
- Directly addresses documented pain point about applicant anxiety
- Reduces manual work for reviewers responding to status inquiries
- Provides audit trail mentioned in requirements

**Stakeholder Value:**
- **Applicants:** Can view all communications in one place, see confirmation of submission, track status updates
- **Reviewers:** Can log communications systematically rather than saving emails manually
- **Administrators:** Have complete communication history for compliance and process improvement

**Compatibility:** Integrates seamlessly with required Application entity; can be phased in after MVP

---

### Table S2: Application_Change_History - Impact Analysis

**Process Improvement:**
- **Current Pain Point:** "Reviewers would like the ability to compare details across application versions. In the event that an application is sent back, they should be able to see what's changed"
- **Solution:** Automated change tracking eliminates need for manual comparison; highlights exactly what changed between versions
- **Additional Benefit:** Reduces review time on resubmissions; ensures reviewers don't miss changes

**Implementation Priority:** MEDIUM
- Addresses explicit requirement for version comparison
- Not critical for MVP but enhances reviewer efficiency
- Could be implemented using Appian's built-in audit features initially

**Stakeholder Value:**
- **Reviewers:** Quickly identify changes without manually comparing versions; faster resubmission reviews
- **Applicants:** Better understanding that changes are being reviewed (if shown what reviewer is looking at)
- **Administrators:** Data for analyzing common changes and improving wizard guidance

**Compatibility:** Integrates with Application entity; can capture changes via application layer logging

---

### Table R13: Denial_Reason - Impact Analysis

**Process Improvement:**
- **Current Pain Point:** Form shows checkboxes for common denial reasons suggesting structured approach is needed
- **Solution:** Standardized denial reasons enable reporting on patterns, help applicants understand requirements better
- **Additional Benefit:** Can drive improvements to wizard by identifying most common applicant mistakes

**Implementation Priority:** LOW
- Nice to have for reporting and process improvement
- Can be implemented with simple text field initially, enhanced later
- Not critical for MVP functionality

**Stakeholder Value:**
- **Reviewers:** Consistent denial messaging; faster denial processing with standard reasons
- **Applicants:** Clear understanding of why denied; can address specific issues if reapplying
- **Administrators:** Reporting on denial patterns to improve process and communications
- **Leadership:** Metrics on application quality and common gaps

**Compatibility:** Simple foreign key addition to Application entity; can be added without disrupting core model

## GAPS AND VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### High-Risk Gaps
*Issues that could break core business processes*

**1. Course Data Import Frequency and Timing**
- **Gap:** "Approximately once a month, 12 future months of course data will be imported" - but what about urgent course additions or changes between monthly imports?
- **Risk:** Contract courses added between imports cannot be applied for; date changes could invalidate applications in progress
- **Validation Question:** What is the process for adding or updating course data outside the monthly import cycle? Who has authority to manually add courses?

**2. Multiple Course Application PDF Generation**
- **Gap:** "Applicant can request to take multiple courses" with "individual prerequisite validation" - are separate PDFs generated for each course, or one combined PDF?
- **Risk:** Audit requirements may require separate signed PDFs per course as stated, but workflow needs clarification
- **Validation Question:** When applicant applies for 3 courses, are 3 separate OSHA Prerequisite Verification forms generated and signed? Or one form listing all courses?
- **Current Model Assumption:** Separate PDF per course based on "generate a pdf for each course they are applying for"

**3. Prerequisite Course Requirements - Alternative Logic**
- **Gap:** OSHA #5600 requires "OSHA #500 OR #501 OR #5400" but data model needs clear rules for OR vs. AND logic
- **Risk:** System may incorrectly validate prerequisites if logic is not explicitly defined
- **Validation Question:** For prerequisites with alternatives, how should the system track which alternative was satisfied? Should junction table include "alternative_group" logic?
- **Current Model Solution:** `Course_Prerequisite_Requirement.alternative_group` field groups alternatives

**4. Resubmission After "Returned for Information"**
- **Gap:** "Applications that were sent back for review are not closed automatically. Resubmissions from applicants shall be tracked on the same application case" - but does this require re-signing the PDF?
- **Risk:** DocuSign workflow may be complex if applicant edits require new signature
- **Validation Question:** When application is returned and applicant makes changes, do they re-sign via DocuSign? Does reviewer see old signed version and new unsigned version, or is old version invalidated?
- **Current Model Assumption:** "The application may need to be re-signed if they edit and re-submit" suggests new signature required

**5. Watch List Match Criteria**
- **Gap:** Watch list checking process not clearly defined - matching by name only, or also email, other identifiers?
- **Risk:** False positives or false negatives in watch list matching
- **Validation Question:** What fields are used to match applicants against watch lists? Name only? Email? Both? How are similar names handled?

### Medium-Risk Gaps
*Issues that could affect secondary features*

**6. Course Registration Code Validation**
- **Gap:** "registration code from their employer, which the system will validate" - but validation mechanism not specified
- **Risk:** System cannot validate codes if they're just imported with course data without additional logic
- **Validation Question:** How are registration codes validated? Simple match against Course.registration_code, or more complex logic? Can same code be used by multiple applicants from same employer?
- **Current Model Assumption:** Simple match against `Course.registration_code`

**7. HAZWOPER Course Requirement for #5600**
- **Gap:** OSHA #5600 also requires "completion of the 40-hour HAZWOPER course" but this is not modeled as a prerequisite course
- **Risk:** Missing validation for this prerequisite
- **Validation Question:** Should HAZWOPER be added to Prerequisite_Course reference table? Or tracked differently as it's not an OSHA OTI course?
- **Current Model Gap:** HAZWOPER not included in prerequisite tracking

**8. Journey-Level Credentials for #5600**
- **Gap:** OSHA #5600 allows "possession of journey-level credentials in a building trade union" as alternative to HAZWOPER
- **Risk:** No data structure to track this alternative qualification
- **Validation Question:** How should journey-level credentials be documented and verified? New entity or additional fields in Professional_Certification?
- **Current Model Gap:** Journey-level credentials not modeled

**9. Update Courses (#502, #503, #5402, #5602)**
- **Gap:** Update courses mentioned in form but prerequisites less clearly defined; seem to only require prior authorization
- **Risk:** Validation rules may be incomplete for these course types
- **Validation Question:** What exactly are the prerequisites for update courses? Just a current trainer card? Or also experience requirements?
- **Current Model:** Basic prerequisite structure supports but needs rule clarification

**10. Multi-Facilitator Access**
- **Gap:** "Facilitators: Support course instructors, who will need access to reports on approved participants" - but not clear if multiple facilitators per course
- **Risk:** Reporting may not properly handle facilitator access control
- **Validation Question:** Is there a many-to-many relationship between facilitators and courses? Or does one facilitator handle all courses?
- **Current Model Gap:** No Facilitator entity or Course_Facilitator junction table; assuming Appian role-based access

**11. Supporting Document Requirements**
- **Gap:** "Supporting Documentation uploaded by applicants will be stored in Appian" but specific requirements per course type not fully defined
- **Risk:** Applicants may not upload all required documents
- **Validation Question:** Can system enumerate required documents based on selected course and prerequisites? What are minimum required documents?
- **Current Model:** Junction table supports document tracking but required documents not enforced by structure

### Low-Risk Gaps
*Minor clarifications needed*

**12. Applicant Self-Registration Details**
- **Gap:** "Applicants will have the ability to self register their Appian accounts via an Appian Portal" - but account approval workflow not specified
- **Risk:** Spam accounts or security issues
- **Validation Question:** Are self-registered accounts automatically active or do they require approval? Email verification?
- **Current Model:** `Applicant.is_active` flag supports account management

**13. Administrator Role Scope**
- **Gap:** "Administrators: Application admins that will be able to manage reference data (such as internal watch list)" - but full scope of admin capabilities not defined
- **Risk:** Security model may be incomplete
- **Validation Question:** What other reference data can admins manage? Courses? Prerequisites? Or just watch list?
- **Current Model Assumption:** Admin role managed via Appian security groups

**14. Leadership Role Access**
- **Gap:** "Leadership: Read-only role with ability to see most or all data in the system" - but "most or all" is ambiguous
- **Risk:** May expose PII inappropriately or restrict necessary access
- **Validation Question:** What data should leadership NOT see? Individual applicant PII? Or all application data fair game?
- **Current Model Assumption:** Appian role-based security controls access

**15. Spanish Translation Scope**
- **Gap:** "English and Spanish for applicant experience" but not clear if PDFs generated in Spanish
- **Risk:** Spanish-speaking applicants may still need to sign English PDFs
- **Validation Question:** Is the official OSHA Prerequisite Verification PDF available in Spanish, or just the wizard interface?
- **Current Model:** `Applicant.preferred_language_code` supports language preference but PDF generation may be English only

## STAKEHOLDER VALIDATION QUESTIONS

### For OSHA Approvers (Reviewers)

**Application Processing:**
1. When an application is "Returned for Information," do you expect to see exactly what changed when the applicant resubmits, or do you re-review the entire application?
2. How do you currently handle watch list checks? Do you check both lists for every applicant, or only when you have reason to suspect an issue?
3. For non-USF prerequisite certificates, how often do you actually contact other OTI centers? Is this for all certificates or only suspicious ones?
4. When reviewing employment history, do you ever contact the listed references, or is this just required for applicant accountability?

**Prerequisite Validation:**
5. For courses with alternative prerequisites (like #5600 requiring #500 OR #501 OR #5400), how do you document which path the applicant satisfied?
6. When a degree or certification substitutes for 2 years of experience, do you still require the applicant to document that they have at least some relevant experience, or can the full 5 years be 3 years work + 2 years substitution?

**Workflow:**
7. Do you review applications in the order received, or prioritize by course date (closest first)?
8. When you approve an application, who actually sends the Enrole registration link - you manually, or should the system auto-generate and send?

### For Applicants (User Experience)

**Application Process:**
1. If you're applying for multiple courses at once, would you prefer one combined form or separate forms per course?
2. When you upload supporting documents, would you find it helpful if the system told you exactly which documents are still needed based on your course selection?
3. If your application is returned for more information, how would you prefer to communicate with the reviewer - structured form, email, or both?

**Document Upload:**
4. What types of documents do you typically have trouble uploading (format, size, quality issues)?
5. Would you find it useful to save a draft application and return later, or do you prefer to complete in one session?

### For Administrators

**Data Management:**
1. Watch list import: Is the current monthly manual upload acceptable, or would you prefer automated integration if possible?
2. Course data import: What happens if a course needs to be added or changed between monthly imports? Who handles this?
3. Who should have authority to manually add/edit reference data (certification types, prerequisite courses, etc.)?

**System Configuration:**
4. Should the system enforce the 35% safety work threshold automatically, or should reviewers have discretion to override?
5. Should there be configurable validation rules, or are the federal requirements fixed and unlikely to change?

### For Leadership

**Reporting & Metrics:**
1. What are the most important metrics you want to track (approval rates, bottlenecks, popular courses, etc.)?
2. Do you need historical data preserved indefinitely, or can old applications be archived after a certain period?
3. Should reports be real-time or is daily/weekly refresh acceptable?

**Compliance:**
4. For audit purposes, how long must application records and supporting documents be retained?
5. Are there specific audit reports or exports you anticipate needing?

---

## ENHANCEMENT VALIDATION QUESTIONS

### Application_Communication Table (S1)
1. Should applicants be able to initiate communications through the system, or only view system-generated messages and reviewer responses?
2. Should communication history be visible to all reviewers, or only the assigned reviewer?
3. What types of communications should trigger email notifications vs. just in-system notifications?
4. **Priority Confirmation:** Does this high-priority enhancement align with your pain points around applicant follow-ups?

### Application_Change_History Table (S2)
1. Should change history show all field changes, or only changes to specific critical fields?
2. Should applicants also see their own change history, or is this just for reviewers?
3. Would side-by-side comparison view be valuable, or is a change log sufficient?
4. **Priority Confirmation:** Is automated change tracking worth the implementation effort, or could reviewers manage with manual comparison initially?

### Denial_Reason Reference Table (R13)
1. Should reviewers be able to select multiple denial reasons, or only one primary reason?
2. Should denied applicants see the specific denial reason(s), or just general "not approved" status?
3. Are the denial reasons from the OSHA form the complete list, or should there be additional USF-specific reasons?
4. **Priority Confirmation:** Can this be deferred to post-MVP, or is structured denial tracking important from day one?

## PROTOTYPE SCENARIOS

To validate the data model, consider walking through these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Simple First-Time Application**
- New applicant registers account
- Applies for OSHA #500 (Construction Trainer)
- Provides OSHA #510 completion from 3 years ago (valid)
- Documents 6 years construction safety experience
- No degree or certifications
- Not on watch lists
- Approver reviews and approves

**Expected Data Flow:** Verify all entities capture necessary data without gaps

**Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Course Application with Substitutions**
- Existing applicant applies for both OSHA #500 and #501
- Has bachelor's degree in OSH (substitutes 2 years)
- Has CSP certification (substitutes 2 years, but max is 2 total)
- Documents 3 years combined construction and general industry experience
- Provides OSHA #510 and #511 completions (both valid)
- Approver validates and approves

**Expected Data Flow:** Verify education, certification, and experience substitution logic works correctly; verify two Application_Course records with separate prerequisite validation

**Scenario 3: Application Returned for Information**
- Applicant submits OSHA #5400 (Maritime) application
- Provides OSHA #5410 completion but certificate is 8 years old (expired)
- Reviewer returns application requesting valid prerequisite
- Applicant takes new #5410 course and updates application
- System tracks this as version 2 of same application
- Reviewer sees what changed and approves

**Expected Data Flow:** Verify version tracking, change history, parent_application_id linkage work correctly

**Scenario 4: Watch List with Reinstatement**
- Applicant submits OSHA #501 application
- Reviewer checks watch lists and finds applicant on OTI internal list
- System requires reinstatement letter
- Applicant uploads official OSHA reinstatement letter
- Reviewer validates letter and approves application

**Expected Data Flow:** Verify Watch_List_Check junction table, Watch_List_Entry lookup, Reinstatement_Letter sub-process

**Scenario 5: Contract Course Registration**
- Applicant browses available courses
- Sees contract course but cannot proceed without registration code
- Enters employer-provided registration code
- System validates code matches Course.registration_code
- Application proceeds normally

**Expected Data Flow:** Verify Course.is_contract_course and Course.registration_code validation

**Scenario 6: Facilitator Report Generation**
- Facilitator needs list of approved applicants for OSHA #500 course starting next month
- System queries Application_Course where course matches and is_approved = TRUE
- Report shows applicant names, emails, approval dates
- Facilitator uses this to verify enrollment with Enrole

**Expected Data Flow:** Verify reporting query works across Application, Application_Course, Applicant, Course entities

## FINAL NOTES

This data model supports all documented business processes from the USF OSHA Prerequisites requirements while maintaining strict source traceability. Key design decisions:

1. **Separate Application_Course entity** enables individual prerequisite validation per course within multi-course applications
2. **Robust prerequisite tracking** with temporal validation supports 7-year validity windows and complex course requirements
3. **Watch list sub-process** fully modeled with junction table and reinstatement letter entity
4. **Version tracking** supports resubmission workflow with change history
5. **Document management** via junction table maintains audit trail per requirements
6. **Appian platform compatibility** with surrogate integer primary keys and 4NF normalization
7. **Enhancement suggestions** address documented pain points without inventing new functionality

**Ready for stakeholder review and validation question resolution.**
