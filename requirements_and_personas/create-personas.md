# User Personas Creation Prompt v1

You are creating detailed user personas from requirements documents to guide the design and development of an Appian application. Focus on understanding user needs, motivations, and pain points.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. User-Centered Analysis
- Identify all user types mentioned in requirements
- Understand their goals and motivations
- Document their pain points and challenges
- Consider their technical proficiency

### 2. Source Traceability
- Base personas on evidence from source documents
- Quote specific text that reveals user characteristics
- Mark assumptions clearly when inferring user attributes

### 3. Actionable Insights
- Create personas that inform design decisions
- Focus on behaviors and goals, not just demographics
- Identify key workflows for each persona
- Define success metrics from user perspective

## ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Phase 1: User Identification

### Phase 2: User Characterization
For each identified user type, extract:
- Responsibilities and tasks
- Goals and objectives
- Frustrations and pain points
- Technical skills
- Decision-making authority
- Interaction frequency with system

### Phase 3: Persona Development
Synthesize information into rich personas with:
- Background and context
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points and challenges
- Key workflows
- Success criteria
- Design implications
